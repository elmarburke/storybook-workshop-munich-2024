# Getting Started

## What is this?

This is your component workshop. You can write simple and quick documentations in markdown here, but you
can also use the full power of React to create interactive examples and guides.

## What we'll explore today:

-   Why everything is so complex
-   How to create a story
-   How to test the UI with less effort
-   Document UI for the team
-   Share how the UI actually works
-   How to make the UI accessible
-   How to share designs with the team
